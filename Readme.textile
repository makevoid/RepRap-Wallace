STL diff: https://github.com/makevoid-3D/RepRap-Wallace/commit/0ecb856435821e9576158b46b164370751ca285a (thanks github!)

- X carriage reworked for small jhead - github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/blob/master/stl/x_carriage_jhead.stl
- X carriage alternative for buda heads - github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/blob/master/stl/x_carriage_buda.stl
- Y belt tensioner, to apply to the end of Y's acrylic plate - github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/blob/master/stl/belt_tensioner_custom.stl
- bed mounts are a little taller - github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/blob/master/stl/bed_mounts.stl
- X end left with Z adjustment screw - github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/blob/master/stl/x_end_left.stl ( we actually don't use it much :D )
- spool holder: thingiverse.com/thing:440287
- removed Z couplers and pulleys, we use aluminium Z couplers and X,Y, and small bearings (623 or 624) instead of Y idler pulleys


-- default extruder(s) selected and included in the project github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/tree/master/extruders ( so noobs know what to print :) )
-- fan mount, endstop, washers github.com/makevoid/RepRap_3DM1/tree/master/extra etc 
-- firmware changes and optimization (lowered jerk and accelerations): github.com/makevoid/3DM_Marlin_firmware 

we print almost exclusively PLA, applying glue directly on acrylic that works great or glue + large painter tape


a delta and clay version of this approach would be good - this was years ago - now we recommend these printers:

- http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:318745 (simplified, with short bowden instead of direct extruder, but vslots are cool)
- http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:147055 style for clay


h3. Misc:

- Sanguinololu box
- small gear adjusted for different flows
- Acrylic (plexiglas) build plate and underbed
